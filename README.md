### Tic-Tac-Toe - Raylib Edition

The good old Tic-Tac-Toe.

The first game that I have published & coded in plain C++ only using the raylib library.

Feel free to use the assets provided in this repository, modify the game as much as you want to, just have fun that's what matters :).

Only a 2 Player mode is available so if you want to you may modify the code to perhaps add an AI the player can play with :).
