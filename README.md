### Tic-Tac-Toe - Raylib Edition

The good old Tic-Tac-Toe.

The first game that I have published & coded in plain C++ only using the raylib library.

Feel free to use the assets provided in this repository, modify the game as much as you want to, just have fun that's what matters ヾ(≧▽≦*)o.

Only a 2 Player mode is available so if you want to you may modify the code to perhaps add an AI the player can play with.
